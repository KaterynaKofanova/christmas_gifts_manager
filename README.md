# Christmas Gifts Manager 

This is an intuitive cart approval app for parents. Each child makes a list of gifts they want to receive for Christmas, which are represented as `carts` in [fakestoreapi.com](https://fakestoreapi.com/). A parent (user) can see all children's carts on one page and approve the gifts.

Also, the user can get a discount if the identical products are approved on different childrens carts:
- 2 identical products chosen => 20% reduction for the price of those two items
- 3 identical products chosen => 30% reduction â€¦ and so on.

When the user has made the final choices of approving certain products, these choices are saved to the API and the user can see a final confirmation screen with an easy overview of the approved gifts with possible relating savings as well as disregarded gifts overview.
